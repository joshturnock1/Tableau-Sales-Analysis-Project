# About my first Tableau project
This project involved using tableau public to first create a sales analysis to understand coffee sales for Product Types and Corresponding Products.

Then I created a Seasonal Fluctuations Analysis which helped to understand which product types and products sell best in which month.

Step 3 was creating a State Sales Analysis to understand which states are responsible for the best sales.

Finally, an interactive dashboard was created.
